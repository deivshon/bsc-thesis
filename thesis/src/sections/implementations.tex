\chapter{Implementations}

This chapter aims to present key and peculiar aspects of using Elm to create real world web applications.\\
Two simple applications were implemented and are used here as a track to go over the main points by showing concrete instances of what is being explained:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A one-page ``To do'' application, which serves as an initial approach to The Elm Architecture and deals with the most common Elm patterns;
    \item A ``social network'' application that features multiple dynamic pages, and allows us to explore the aspects of internal URLs handling and dealing with simple cases of JavaScript interoperation.
\end{itemize}
