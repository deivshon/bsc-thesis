\section{Simple Social Network}
The \textit{Simple Social Network} app is a small web application that allows users to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create and log in to different accounts
    \item Create textual posts
    \item Like posts
    \item See recent posts in the homepage
    \item See recent user specific posts in user pages
\end{itemize}
This allows to explore what patterns can be used to handle different pages within the same SPA and interoperate with JavaScript
